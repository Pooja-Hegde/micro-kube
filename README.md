# Introduction

Basic Microservice setup with kubernetes. 

1. API Gateway using Ambassador that routes to authentication service
1. Authentication service that does nothing but checks headers
1. Simple App that returns the index page with nothing but header information from auth service

To design and develop a microservice-based application and deploy it using Kubernetes, several steps need to be followed. Here's an outline of the process:

1. **Design the Application Architecture**:
   - Identify the different components and functionalities of your application.
   - Decompose the application into individual microservices based on these functionalities.
   - Determine the communication protocols and APIs between the microservices.
   - Consider scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience in your design.

2. **Develop the Microservices**:
   - Implement each microservice as a separate codebase, using the programming language and framework of your choice.
   - Ensure that each microservice has a well-defined API and communicates with other microservices through APIs.
   - Implement necessary database connections and external service integrations within each microservice.

3. **Containerize the Microservices**:
   - Create a Dockerfile for each microservice, similar to the previous Dockerfile example.
   - Build Docker images for each microservice using the respective Dockerfiles.
   - Push the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

4. **Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Provision a Kubernetes cluster on your preferred platform (e.g., Kubernetes as a Service, on-premises cluster).
   - Configure the cluster, including network settings, security, and resource allocation.

5. **Define Kubernetes Deployment Manifests**:
   - Create Kubernetes deployment manifests (YAML or JSON files) for each microservice.
   - Specify the Docker image to use for each microservice.
   - Define resource requirements (CPU, memory) for each microservice.
   - Configure networking, such as service endpoints, ports, and load balancing.
   - Define any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

6. **Deploy the Microservices**:
   - Apply the deployment manifests using the `kubectl apply` command to deploy the microservices to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Kubernetes will create the necessary pods, replica sets, and services for each microservice.
   - Monitor the deployment process using `kubectl` commands to ensure the microservices are running successfully.

7. **Test and Validate the Deployment**:
   - Access the microservices through their exposed endpoints within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure the microservices can communicate with each other correctly.
   - Validate the functionality of the application as a whole.

8. **Scale and Manage the Application**:
   - Utilize Kubernetes features to scale the application based on demand.
   - Use Kubernetes tools and commands to monitor the health and performance of the microservices.
   - Apply any necessary updates or configuration changes by modifying the deployment manifests and reapplying them.
